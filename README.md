# React + TypeScript + Vite

#### Versions:

React: 18.2.0
Vite: 5.1.4

####  Setup application
```
npm install
```

#### Run the server
```
npm run dev
```

#### Notes:

The code is not that great due to time constraint, i didn't added any design and i didn't use any library for css like material ui or chakra ui.
I went with the simple axios instead of react query.
